# Chapter 2: From Napkin Sketch to CAD Model

## Initial Concepts

Every design starts somewhere. For the JMC cap, it began with a simple question: "What if the AeroPress filter cap had adjustable flow?"

### The Napkin Stage

The first sketches explored several concepts:

1. **Multi-hole patterns** - Various arrangements of small perforations
2. **Spiral channels** - Creating turbulence for better extraction
3. **Variable aperture** - Adjustable flow like a camera iris
4. **Modular inserts** - Swappable flow plates

## Design Constraints

Before moving to CAD, we established key constraints:

### Physical Requirements
- Must fit AeroPress XL dimensions precisely
- Maintain seal integrity during brewing
- Support standard paper filters
- Withstand brewing temperatures (80-100Â°C)

### Manufacturing Constraints
- Printable on consumer FDM printers
- No support material in critical areas
- Reasonable print times (<2 hours)
- Post-processing minimal

### User Experience
- Easy to clean
- Intuitive to use
- Durable for daily use
- Safe for food contact

## CAD Development

### Version 1: Basic Proof of Concept
```
- Simple cylinder with holes
- Fixed gasket groove
- 0.8mm hole diameter
- Result: Leaked badly, poor flow
```

### Version 2: Improved Sealing
```
- Deeper gasket channel
- Tapered edges
- Multiple hole sizes tested
- Result: Better seal, uneven extraction
```

### Version 3: Flow Optimization
```
- Hexagonal hole pattern
- Gradual thickness transitions
- Integrated drip fins
- Result: Good flow, difficult to clean
```

### Version 4: Current Design
```
- Optimized hole placement
- Smooth internal surfaces
- Dual-material gasket system
- Result: Reliable performance
```

## Design Tools and Workflow

### Software Stack
- **CAD**: Fusion 360 / OpenSCAD
- **Slicing**: PrusaSlicer
- **Analysis**: Flow simulation basics

### Parametric Design
Key parameters made adjustable:
- Hole diameter and count
- Wall thickness
- Gasket groove dimensions
- Overall height

## Lessons Learned

1. **Iterate quickly** - First prints revealed issues immediately
2. **Test with water first** - Save coffee for proven designs
3. **Document everything** - Failed designs teach valuable lessons
4. **Community feedback** - Other users spot issues you miss

## Design Files

All CAD files are available in the repository:
- OpenSCAD source for customization
- STL files for direct printing
- Technical drawings with dimensions

## Next: Material Selection

With the design refined, the next chapter explores choosing the right plastics for safe, effective brewing.
