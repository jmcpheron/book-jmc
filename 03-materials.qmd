# Chapter 3: Choosing the Right Plastics

## Food Safety First

When 3D printing anything that contacts food or beverages, material selection is critical. Not all filaments are created equal.

## Primary Material: PCTG

After extensive research and testing, PCTG (Polyethylene Terephthalate Glycol-Modified) emerged as the ideal choice:

### Why PCTG?
- **Chemical resistance** to coffee acids
- **Temperature stability** up to 80°C+
- **FDA approved** formulations available
- **Clear printing** for visual inspection
- **Low moisture absorption**

### PCTG Specifications
```
Glass transition: 80°C
Print temperature: 245-260°C
Bed temperature: 70-80°C
Chemical formula: (C10H8O4)n
```

## Gasket Material: TPE/TPU

The NoDrip XL uses an optional TPE disc gasket for improved sealing:

### Options Tested
1. **TPU 95A** - Good flexibility, difficult adhesion
2. **TPE 85A** - Excellent seal, tricky to print
3. **Silicone** - Ideal properties, requires casting

### Final Choice: TPE Disc Gasket
- Designed as a separate disc for easy replacement
- Shore hardness ideal for sealing
- No-drip performance when properly installed
- Food-safe formulations available
- Optional component (cap works without it)

## Materials to Avoid

### Never Use
- **ABS** - Releases harmful fumes, not food-safe
- **Standard PLA** - Degrades with heat and moisture
- **Nylon** - Absorbs water, affects coffee taste

### Use with Caution
- **PETG** - Similar to PCTG but less chemical resistant
- **PP** - Difficult to print, may warp
- **PC** - Requires very high temperatures

## Surface Finish Matters

### Layer Adhesion
- Proper temperatures ensure no gaps
- Avoid under-extrusion at all costs
- Consider 110% flow rate for solid walls

### Post-Processing
1. **Sanding** - Removes layer lines
2. **Vapor smoothing** - Not recommended for PCTG
3. **Food-safe coating** - Optional but adds complexity

## Testing for Safety

### Visual Inspection
- Check for gaps between layers
- Ensure no stringing or blobs
- Verify smooth internal surfaces

### Water Testing
1. Submerge in hot water (90°C) for 10 minutes
2. Check for deformation or degradation
3. Inspect for any discoloration

### Practical Testing
- Brew with water only first
- Check for any off-tastes
- Monitor for degradation over time

## Sourcing Materials

### Recommended Brands
- **Prusament PCTG** - Consistent quality
- **FilamentOne PCTG** - Good clarity
- **NinjaTek Chinchilla** - Excellent TPE

### What to Look For
- FDA compliance statements
- MSDS availability
- Consistent diameter (±0.02mm)
- Proper storage (sealed, dry)

## Storage and Handling

### Filament Storage
- Sealed containers with desiccant
- Print directly from dry box if possible
- PCTG: <20% humidity ideal

### Printed Parts
- Wash with dish soap before first use
- Store dry between uses
- Replace if any degradation appears

## The Microplastics Question

This deserves its own chapter — see Chapter 6 for a detailed discussion of microplastic concerns and mitigation strategies.

## Key Takeaways

1. **PCTG** is the optimal choice for the main body
2. **TPE** provides excellent gasket properties
3. **Surface quality** matters as much as material
4. **Regular inspection** ensures continued safety

Next, we'll dive into the actual printing process and settings that make it all work.
