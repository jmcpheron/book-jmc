# Chapter 4: Printing Your Cap

## Printer Requirements

### Minimum Specifications
- **Build volume**: 120 x 120 x 30mm
- **Nozzle temperature**: 260°C capability
- **Bed temperature**: 80°C heated bed
- **Layer resolution**: 0.2mm or finer

### Recommended Features
- Enclosed chamber (helps with PCTG)
- All-metal hotend
- Automatic bed leveling
- Part cooling fan control

## Slicer Settings

### PCTG Main Body (NoDrip XL Cap)

```
Layer height: 0.2mm
First layer: 0.3mm
Perimeters: 3
Top layers: 4
Bottom layers: 4
Infill: 15% gyroid (more recommended)
Print speed: 40mm/s
Temperature: 255°C
Bed temperature: 80°C
Retraction: 3mm @ 35mm/s
Ironing: All top surfaces
Supports: Suggested for locking tab overhang
```

### TPE Disc Gasket (Optional)

```
Layer height: 0.2mm
Perimeters: 3
Infill: 95%
Print speed: 20mm/s
Temperature: 230°C
Bed temperature: 50°C
Retraction: Disabled
Note: Print separately as a disc
```

## Critical Print Considerations

### Bed Adhesion
1. **Clean glass bed** with isopropyl alcohol
2. **PEI sheet** provides excellent adhesion
3. **Glue stick** as backup for stubborn prints
4. **No brim needed** if bed is properly prepared

### First Layer
- Watch the first layer completely
- Should be slightly squished but not transparent
- Uniform width across entire perimeter
- No gaps between lines

### Support Material
- Locking tab overhang may need supports with droopy PCTG
- Use tree supports for minimal contact
- Remove carefully to preserve tab integrity
- Rest of design prints support-free

## Multi-Material Printing

### Option 1: Separate Prints
1. Print PCTG body first
2. Print TPE gasket separately
3. Press-fit assembly

### Option 2: Multi-Material
1. Use MMU or tool changer
2. Print both materials in one go
3. Requires careful purge settings

## Quality Checks During Printing

### Layer Adhesion
- No visible gaps between layers
- Walls appear solid and uniform
- No stringing between features

### Dimensional Accuracy
- Measure critical dimensions:
  - Outer diameter: 67.5mm ±0.1mm
  - Inner diameter: 63.0mm ±0.1mm
  - Height: 12.0mm ±0.1mm

## Common Issues and Solutions

### Warping
**Problem**: Corners lifting from bed
**Solution**: 
- Increase bed temperature to 80°C
- Add enclosure or draft shield
- Check for drafts in room

### Poor Layer Adhesion
**Problem**: Layers separating
**Solution**:
- Increase nozzle temperature 5°C
- Reduce print speed to 35mm/s
- Check for partial clogs

### Stringing
**Problem**: Fine strings between features
**Solution**:
- Increase retraction to 4mm
- Lower temperature 5°C
- Increase travel speed

### Elephant's Foot
**Problem**: First layer bulges out
**Solution**:
- Reduce first layer flow to 95%
- Raise nozzle 0.05mm
- Reduce bed temperature 5°C

## Post-Processing

### Required Steps
1. **Remove from bed** carefully when cool
2. **Inspect all surfaces** for defects
3. **Test fit** with AeroPress XL
4. **Clean thoroughly** before use

### Optional Improvements
1. **Light sanding** of contact surfaces
2. **Compressed air** to clear holes
3. **Acetone wipe** for fingerprints (PCTG safe)

## Print Time Estimates

- PCTG body: ~90 minutes
- TPE gasket: ~25 minutes
- Total time: ~2 hours

## Troubleshooting Guide

### Print Fails at Holes
- Reduce speed to 30mm/s for small features
- Ensure part cooling fan at 100%
- Consider 0.15mm layers for detail

### TPE Won't Stick
- Clean bed extra thoroughly
- Use hairspray or TPU adhesive
- Increase first layer temperature 10°C

### Dimensions Off
- Calibrate E-steps
- Check filament diameter
- Adjust horizontal expansion

## Success Tips

1. **Dry filament** is crucial for PCTG
2. **Take your time** with bed leveling
3. **Print a test piece** before full cap
4. **Keep notes** on successful settings
