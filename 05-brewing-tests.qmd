### Equipment Used
- AeroPress XL
- Acaia Pearl scale (0.1g precision)
- Hario V60 thermometer
- Timer app
- Various coffee origins

### Standard Recipe
```
Coffee: 18g (medium grind)
Water: 250g at 85°C
Method: Inverted
Steep time: Variable
Total brew time: 2:30
```

## Baseline Testing

### Stock AeroPress Cap
- **Flow rate**: ~125ml/30sec
- **Total brew time**: 1:45
- **TDS**: 1.35%
- **Extraction yield**: 18.5%

### JMC Flow Restriction Cap
- **Flow rate**: ~60ml/30sec
- **Total brew time**: 2:30
- **TDS**: 1.48%
- **Extraction yield**: 20.5%

## Detailed Test Results

### Test 1: Ethiopian Light Roast
**Setup**: 
- 17g coffee, 250g water
- Grind: 18 clicks on Comandante

**Results**:
| Parameter | Stock Cap | JMC Cap |
|-----------|-----------|---------|
| Brew time | 1:42 | 2:28 |
| TDS | 1.28% | 1.42% |
| Yield | 18.8% | 20.9% |
| Notes | Bright, acidic | Balanced, sweet |

### Test 2: Colombian Medium Roast
**Setup**:
- 18g coffee, 250g water  
- Grind: 16 clicks on Comandante

**Results**:
| Parameter | Stock Cap | JMC Cap |
|-----------|-----------|---------|
| Brew time | 1:38 | 2:35 |
| TDS | 1.41% | 1.56% |
| Yield | 19.5% | 21.6% |
| Notes | Chocolate, nutty | Complex, syrupy |

### Test 3: Pressure Profiling
Using different pressing speeds:

1. **Slow press** (45 seconds)
   - More clarity
   - Higher acidity
   - Clean finish

2. **Medium press** (30 seconds)
   - Balanced extraction
   - Good body
   - Sweet

3. **Fast press** (15 seconds)
   - Similar to stock cap
   - Less complexity
   - Efficient for rushed mornings

## Temperature Stability

### Heat Retention Test
- Stock cap: -8°C over 2 minutes
- JMC cap: -6°C over 2 minutes
- Difference: Better heat retention due to restricted flow

## Grind Size Adjustments

### Coarser Grind Benefits
With flow restriction, coarser grinds become viable:
- Reduced channeling
- Even extraction
- Less sediment

### Recommended Adjustments
- Light roasts: 2-3 clicks coarser
- Medium roasts: 1-2 clicks coarser  
- Dark roasts: Keep same or 1 click coarser

## User Experience

### Positive Feedback
- "Much sweeter cups"
- "Less bitterness even with longer steep"
- "Feel more in control"
- "Great for light roasts"

### Challenges
- "Takes getting used to pressing force"
- "Longer total brew time"
- "Need to adjust recipes"

## Recipe Recommendations

### Light Roast Recipe
```
Dose: 17g
Water: 250g at 88°C
Grind: Medium-coarse
Time: 0:30 bloom, 2:00 steep
Press: 30 seconds
```

### Medium Roast Recipe
```
Dose: 18g
Water: 250g at 85°C
Grind: Medium
Time: 0:20 bloom, 1:40 steep
Press: 30 seconds
```

### Espresso-Style Recipe
```
Dose: 22g
Water: 100g at 92°C
Grind: Fine-medium
Time: 0:30 steep
Press: 45 seconds
```

## Cleaning and Maintenance

### Daily Cleaning
1. Rinse immediately after use
2. Weekly soap wash
3. Check gasket seal
4. Inspect holes for clogs

### Long-term Care
- Replace gasket every 6 months
- Deep clean monthly
- Store dry

## Conclusion

The JMC cap consistently produces:
- **Higher extraction yields** (+2-3%)
- **Increased sweetness**
- **Better heat retention**
- **More control** over brewing

Trade-offs include:
- Longer brew times
- Learning curve
- Regular maintenance

For those seeking better extraction and willing to experiment, the results speak for themselves.
