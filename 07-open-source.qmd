# Chapter 7: Contributing to Open Hardware

## Why Open Source?

### Community Benefits
- **Collective improvement** through iteration
- **Accessibility** for all skill levels
- **Transparency** in design decisions
- **Education** through shared knowledge

### Personal Benefits
- Learn from others' modifications
- Get feedback on designs
- Build reputation in maker community
- Contribute to coffee culture

## Licensing Your Work

### Choosing a License

1. **CERN Open Hardware License**
   - Designed specifically for hardware
   - Strong copyleft provisions
   - Requires attribution

2. **CC BY-SA**
   - Creative Commons Attribution-ShareAlike
   - Good for documentation
   - Widely understood

3. **MIT/Apache**
