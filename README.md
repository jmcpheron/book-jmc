# ☕️ JMC: Brewing Better with Plastic — A 3D-Printed AeroPress Filter Cap

This is the companion book for the **Jason Makes Coffee (JMC)** project — an open-source exploration into building a custom 3D-printed **flow-restriction filter cap** for the AeroPress XL.

Built with [Quarto](https://quarto.org/), this book documents the full design process, prototyping iterations, material choices, and brewing experiments. Whether you're a maker, coffee nerd, or just someone who loves fiddling with gaskets, you're in the right place.
