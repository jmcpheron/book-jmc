# Welcome to JMC

Welcome to **Jason Makes Coffee** â€” a journey into the intersection of 3D printing, coffee brewing, and open-source hardware design.

## About This Book

This book documents the design and development of a custom flow-restriction filter cap for the AeroPress XL. What started as a simple desire for better coffee control evolved into an exploration of:

- **Engineering Design**: From concept sketches to CAD models
- **Material Science**: Understanding plastics, food safety, and microplastics
- **Rapid Prototyping**: Iterating through 3D-printed designs
- **Coffee Science**: How flow restriction affects extraction

## Who This Book Is For

Whether you're:

- A **maker** interested in functional 3D printing projects
- A **coffee enthusiast** looking to modify your brewing setup
- An **engineer** curious about design iteration processes
- Someone interested in **open-source hardware** development

You'll find something valuable in these pages.

## What You'll Learn

Throughout this book, we'll cover:

1. The motivation behind creating custom coffee hardware
2. Design principles for food-safe 3D printing
3. Practical prototyping workflows
4. Real-world testing and iteration
5. Considerations for sharing open-source hardware

## Getting Started

Each chapter builds on the previous, but feel free to jump to sections that interest you most. All design files, code, and resources are available in the project repository.

Let's brew something better together.
